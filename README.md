# Void Scanner

The core sensor data collection engine for the **Nethervoid Network** — a parallel dimension game layer exploring the void between networked devices.

> *"Peer into the nethervoid all around us. Decode the signatures left by passing devices. Reveal the echoes of existence that flow through the air and network."*

## Overview

Void Scanner is an isolated Android application that exhaustively collects WiFi and Bluetooth sensor data offline-first — the foundation for procedural generation and world-building in the Nethervoid experience. Unlike traditional scanning tools, Void Scanner treats every signal as a signature in the void, creating a deterministic fingerprint of the environment.

### Integration Context

Void Scanner serves as the **Void Resonator** component in the Nethervoid Network. The scanner:
1. Emits **deterministic seeds** from sensor data to generate game entities (planned)
2. Provides real-time feedback and post-scan summarization for the Nethervoid game layer
3. Operates independently as a test platform, then integrates into the full Nethervoid application

## Features

### Sensor Collection
- **WiFi Scouting**: Exhaustive network scan with SSID, BSSID, RSSI, frequency, security type
- **Bluetooth Resonance**: BLE beacon detection with device addresses and signal strength
- **Timestamped Exports**: Every scan produces a traceable JSON record
- **Privacy-Aware**: Real builds anonymize PII; debug builds include raw data

### Export Capability
- **Downloads Folder Export**: JSON files saved to `Downloads/VoidScanner/`
- **Metadata Tracking**: Timestamp, device model, Android version, app version
- **Anonymization**: SSID/BSSID hashed; location coordinates obfuscated in release builds

### Design Philosophy
- **Offline-First**: Works without network, entirely local to device
- **Deterministic Generation**: Sensor fingerprints drive procedural content (planned)
- **Sensor-Mesh Architecture**: Every signal is a possible entity or anchor in the void
- **Test-Isolated**: Separated package structure enables independent development and iteration

### Versioning

Void Scanner uses **semantic versioning (SemVer)** with leading zero padding for minor revisions (00-99):

| **Current Version**: 1.1.04 |
| **Semantic Version Format**: `X.Y.Z` |
  - **X (MAJOR)**: Breaking changes, major features
  - **Y (MINOR)**: New features, compatible additions (padded to 2 digits: 01-99)
  - **Z (PATCH)**: Bug fixes, minor improvements (padded to 2 digits: 00-99) |
- **Version Code**: Auto-incremented based on semantic ordering
- **Target API**: Android 10+ (API 29+)
- **Package Name**: `com.bubo.voidscanner`

#### Version Examples

| Version | Meaning | Change Type |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1.1.04 → 1.02.00 | New feature release, breaking API additions | Minor increment, PATCH reset |
| 1.1.04 → 1.01.01 | Bug fix only, no API changes | PATCH increment |

See [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for full specification.

#### Version Update Workflow

1. **New Release** (increment MINOR, reset PATCH):
   - Bump `APP_VERSION_MINOR` in `gradle.properties` and reset `APP_VERSION_PATCH=00`
   - Task naming: Create new task with `t_<major>_<minor>_<patch>` pattern
   - Version code increments based on semantic ordering

2. **Patch Release** (increment PATCH):
   - Increment `APP_VERSION_PATCH` by 1 in `gradle.properties`
   - Use leading zero padding: 0 → 01, 99 → 99
   - Task naming: Continue using same minor version, increment patch

3. **Create GitHub Release**:
   ```bash
   gh release create void-scanner-1.1.04
   ```

#### Version Configuration

Version properties are centralized in `gradle.properties`:

```properties
APP_VERSION_MAJOR=1
APP_VERSION_MINOR=01
APP_VERSION_PATCH=00
```

### Dependencies
- **Gson**: JSON serialization (offline, local)
- **Android X AppCompat**: Backward compatibility layer
- **ConstraintLayout**: Responsive UI
- **OkHttp**: Placeholder for future APIs (not yet integrated)
- **Google Play Services**: Planned for Sheets integration (future)
